in here ,  I have put some of my work for people out there
# generate 
  ## uses
    the generate file is a script that  generates all the possible layers of a PSD project/document/file. 
    I personnally used it for an nft project where u need to generate all the possible choices for  a background,accessories,etc...
  ## how to use
    run it in photoshop scripts 
  ## how it works
    It runs though every photoshop layer and exports it with a  different hue/saturation value where the difference is visible 
# combine
  ## uses
    the combine file is a script that combines the elements from a multiple files into one pictures it outputs every possible solution
    i used it to combine the outputs of @generate script into one picture as a png
  ## how to use 
    same as generate  run with photoshop scripts
    choose folders from where you want to  combine the layers/ photos
